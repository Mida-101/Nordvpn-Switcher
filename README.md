# Nordvpnswitcher

A bash-script that let's you automatically switch between different 4 countries in VPN for some extra privacy/security. You'll be hopping all over the world.
To use this script you need to have installed nordvpn deb. This (to my knowledge) excludes kali from using this switcher.

To use, just follow these steps:

1) Git clone to location (or download the script to the location you want)
2) chmod +x ./Nordvpn-switcher
3) Run the script ./Nordvpn-switcher
4) Enter 4 countries you want to switch between to.
5) Let the good times roll.
